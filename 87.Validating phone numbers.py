The above statement is validating the number/count of digits is 10 or not also

one digit out of [7,8,9] ==> One digit count done \d means any number of digits but here we used \d{9} which means 9 digits

previously 1 digit and later on 9 digits ==> total 10 digits were counted and validated

if you want to make a phone number with 11 digit validation try below and check so that doubts will get resolved

[789]\d{10}$
